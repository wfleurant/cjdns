
The rumor mill is for new nodes which have been discovered by search and
getPeers requests but, we(who?) have never actually communicated with them so 
we(who?) are not sure if they exist. More importantly, we(who?) *cannot* link
them into the nodeStore tree because we(who?) are not sure of their encoding
scheme.

### RumorMill

- int count;
  - TODO: Provide some more information about this one.
